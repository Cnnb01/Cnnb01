### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Charity




I'm currently a full-time student in different programs ðŸ˜„ but let's just say I'm a software engineering student enrolled in the ALX Africa program. I am currently learning C, Python, JS, and SQL, just to but a few. Ultimately my goal is to become a highly skilled front-end software engineer and build solutions that help solve world problems.
